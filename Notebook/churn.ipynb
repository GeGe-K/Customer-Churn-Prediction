    "### Introduction:\n",
    "Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses operating in subscription-based industries such as telecommunications, software as a service (SaaS), and retail. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or (unsubscribe) stop using its services. It is essential for businesses to identify and understand the factors that contribute to churn in order to take proactive measures to retain customers and maximize revenue."

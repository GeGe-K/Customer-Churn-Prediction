    "### Introduction:\n",
    "Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses operating in subscription-based industries such as telecommunications, software as a service (SaaS), and retail. Churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company or (unsubscribe) stop using its services. It is essential for businesses to identify and understand the factors that contribute to churn in order to take proactive measures to retain customers and maximize revenue."

    "#### **Project Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's world of machine leaening, most companies build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers. We have been tasked to create a prediction model for a telecommunication compant to help predict if a customer will churn or not. We are also to help them understand their data and know what factors affect the rate at which customers stop using their network to understand their data.\n",

    "2. How does the different boolean attributes affect the churn?\n",
    "3. How does the different non-boolean attributes affect the churn?\n",
    "4. How does the different numerical attributes affect the churn?\n",
    "5. How does tenure affect the churn?\n",
    "6. How does the type of internet service affect churn?\n",
    "7. How does the type of contract affect the churn?\n",
